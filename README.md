# Diversity-Inclusion

The telecom client, in partnership with PwC Switzerland, aims to enhance executive gender balance through diversity and inclusion initiatives. 

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) have been developed to measure progress in hiring, promotion, performance, and turnover, with the overarching goal of fostering a valued and inclusive environment for all teams. By tracking the percentage of hires, we ensure recruitment practices promote a balanced workforce from the outset. Measuring the percentage of promotions among men and women allows us to identify and celebrate talent, ensuring opportunities are equitable and merit-based. Assessing average performance ratings by gender helps pinpoint potential biases and ensures a fair evaluation system. Monitoring turnover percentages among men and women helps identify areas of concern and ensures the retention of diverse talent. The ultimate goal is a practical approach to addressing gender balance challenges, not only by setting strategic objectives but also by continuously measuring, analyzing, and improving diversity and inclusion initiatives.
